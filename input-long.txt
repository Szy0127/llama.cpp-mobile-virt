summarize the following paragraph:This paper presents our results toward overcoming these limitations, synthesized in a CC design named Blindfold. Like many other CC solutions, Blindfold relies on a small trusted software component running at a higher privilege level than the kernel, called Guardian. It features three techniques that can enhance existing CC solutions. First, instead of nesting page tables, Blindfold’s Guardian mediates how the OS accesses memory and handles exceptions by switching page and interrupt tables. Second, Blindfold employs a lightweight capability system to regulate the OS’s semantic access to user memory, unifying case-by-case approaches in previous work. Finally, Blindfold provides carefully designed secure ABI for confidential memory management without encryption.
